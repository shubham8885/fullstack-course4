      <span style="color: white">
Biryani is a mixed rice dish with its origins 
among the Indian subcontinent.
   It can be compared to mixing a curry, later 
   combining it with
    semi-cooked rice separately.
   It is also prepared in other regions such as 
   Iraqi Kurdistan. 
   It is made with Indian spices, rice, meat (chicken,
    beef, goat, pork, lamb, prawn,or fish),
   vegetables or eggs.
   The word 'biryani' is derived from a Persian word,
    birian, which means 
   fried before cooking.
   It is one of the most popular dishes, which has 
   acquired a niche for
    itself in South Asian cuisine.

      <span style="color: white">A fish fry is a meal ncontaining 
        battered or breaded fried fish.
      It usually also includes french fries, coleslaw, hushpuppies, 
      lemon slices, tartar sauce, hot sauce, malt vinegar and dessert. 
      Some Native American versions are cooked by coating fish 
      with semolina and egg yolk.
      Fish is often served on Friday nights during Lent as a 
      restaurant special or through church fundraisers.
      Beer is a common beverage of choice to accompany a fish fry. 
      A fish fry may include potato pancakes
       (with accompanying side dishes of sour cream or applesauce) 
      and sliced caraway rye bread if served in a German restaurant or area.
      A Shore Lunch is traditional in
       the northern United States and Canada. 
      For decades, outdoor enthusiasts have 
      been cooking their catch on the shores of their favorite lakes. 
      Fish fries are very common in the Midwestern and
       northeastern regions of the United States.
      This is especially true


       for predominantly Roman 


    Catholic communities on Fridays 

    during Lent, when 
  regulations call for abstinence from most meat products.</span></section>
